# cs373project1

This is a Facility Management System project for our Comp 373/473 Class. It's purpose is to implement the features named in the instructions given and simplify dependency.

The project has 3 main structures: the data acess layer, the model layer, and the view layer.
The UML diagram shows the interactions between the three different layers as well as the interactions between the separate classes within the layers.

In order to test the program it would be easier to compile and run "FacilityClient.java" in the cs373p1/src/src/View/ folder. This will run through all the classes in the model layer as well as instantiate interactions with the data access layer. It will also create test objects.
